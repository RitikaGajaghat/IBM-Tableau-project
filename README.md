Tableau Dashboard: IBM Employee Insights

I created a Tableau dashboard that provides key insights into IBM's workforce:

Income Analysis: See average monthly income by department and job role.
Demographics: Explore gender and marital status distributions.
Education Fields: Understand the educational backgrounds of employees.
Experience: Learn about employees' previous work experiences.
Age Insights: Analyze average ages by department and role.

This project showcases my data visualization and analytical skills, enabling data-driven HR decisions. Explore the interactive dashboard for deeper insights.
